        <h2>How do I get started?</h2>
        <p>Create an original creature that can exist, evolve, and become a part of iPaintCreatures epic sci-fi fantasy anime story world of Matsu. All entries will be judged on creature appeal, incorporation of Matsu world attributes, and character design. </p>
        <p><strong>Submission guidelines:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Draw, paint, sculpt, craft in any of your chosen mediums.</li>
          <li>Choose a realm. <a href="#realms">(All realms explained below)</a> Make your creatures attributes, powers, and features reflect that realm.</li>
          <li>It must be a creature, not a monster. (IPC defines a monster as a creature who got hurt and didn’t heal themselves, so they can hurt and destroy; where as creatures can be strange and particular but not monstrous, harming, and evil.)</li>
          <li>Hashtag all work in progress streams or any of your social media content posted.</li>
          <li>Help promote this contest by posting on your social media accounts. Link this page (<a href="https://ipaintcreatures.com">ipaintcreatures.com</a>) and also a link to follow the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ipaintcreatures">Twitch</a> stream for engagement and more information.</li>
